A social e-commerce app designed the address the environment and consumerism. So much of our resources are spent on items we rarely use: A power drill. A wheelbarrow. A bicycle box. 

Sometimes we throw out stuff that could be easily reused: A desk when you're moving. A lamp that no longer fits your design. 

This is a way to find new homes for the items you no longer want, and more use for the items you don't use as much.
